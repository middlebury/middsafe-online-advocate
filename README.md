# MiddSafe Online Advocate

> The MiddSafe Online Advocate is a tool for peers in need of support and information around sexual assault, stalking, dating violence, domestic violence, and other personal violations. When youâ€™re ready to get started, you will be asked a series of questions in order to find resources that might feel right to you.

## Requirements

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) `sudo gem install jekyll`
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) v18+

## Quick start

```bash
# clone your repo then open terminal in its folder

# install npm packages
npm install

# start local dev server
npm start
```

This will run browser sync server on `http://localhost:3000`. (Browser sync will automatically set it to a different port if you have something running on it. Check what gets output in terminal for the exact URL.)

## Deployment

```bash
npm run deploy
```

1. This will compile jekyll, process and minify CSS and JS, and compress images
2. It will commit the contents of the `_site` directory to the `site` branch and push it to GitHub
3. IT has automated scripts to deploy the contents of the `site` branch on change. Your changes should now be live at its assigned domain.

## Temporary Build Process

If the above instructions don't work, you can manually deploy the project with these steps:

```
git clone git@github.com:middlebury/middsafe-online-advocate.git
cd middsafe-online-advocate
npm cache clear --force
rm package-lock.json
npm install
npm run deploy
cp -r _site ../
git stash
git checkout --track -b site origin/site
cp -r ../_site/* .
git add -u
git commit -m "Deploy changes for #ISSUE"
git push
git checkout master
git stash pop
git reset --hard
```
