faq:
  - question: What is MiddSafe and who are MiddSafe Confidential Advocates?
    answer: MiddSafe Advocates are Middlebury College students committed to providing confidential resources to peers in need of support and information around sexual assault, stalking, dating violence, domestic violence, and other personal violations.
  - question: What is confidentiality and what are its limits?
    answer: |
      Confidentiality is a legal status designated to individuals who will never discuss contacts or contents of conversations held in privilege with anyone except with other confidential resources with whom communication is necessary. Individuals acting in a confidential role take all precautions to ensure that the time, location, and volume of conversations limit the possibility of being overheard while maximizing the safety of the contact and resource. 

      Limits of confidentiality exist when there is a clear and substantial risk of physical danger to self, others, or the community. Such situations are high-risk and/or life-threatening when a person or others are endangered by themselves or someone else (e.g. threats of suicide, threats from others). When substantial risk is present, confidential individuals are required to report to the appropriate professional staff for immediate assistance in order to prioritize individual and community safety. Confidentiality may also be broken if there is a requirement by law (e.g. child abuse or a subpoena) or when confidentiality is waived by the victim/survivor.
  - question: What if I’m not sure what I experienced is considered sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, or is even a big deal?
    answer: MiddSafe Confidential Advocate services are available for anyone who feels they need assistance, support, and advocacy, whether or not the experience qualifies as a “sexual assault” or “personal violation” as defined by themselves, the College, or the state.
  - question: Is the MiddSafe Online Advocate completely anonymous?
    answer: The MiddSafe Online Advocate does not track any information from users. 
  - question:	What if I don’t find answers to my questions through the MiddSafe Online Advocate?
    answer: We hope that you will consider contacting a MiddSafe Confidential Advocate in person or through our 24/7 hotline while classes are in session at 802-377-0239. We are here to listen and help you find resources that feel right to you. You may also refer to the “Resources” tab on the top of each page for a list of contacts that can provide support.
