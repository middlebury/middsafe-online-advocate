- question: |
    It can be upsetting to see a friend struggling or in pain. Providing support to someone who has experienced sexual or relationship violence is no different. These violations can take away people’s sense of power and leave them feeling helpless. Offering gentle, consistent, and nonjudgmental friendship and support can alleviate the strong and confusing emotions your friend or partner may feel.

    Regardless of your own knowledge or experience with sexual or relationship violence, you can play a key role in supporting survivors and restoring their sense of control.

    You can:

    -  Help her focus on her strengths.
    -  Provide a safe place for them to explore their emotions.
    -  Reinforce that no one is responsible for being assaulted, stalked or abused.
    -  Reassure him that he has the right to any and all of his feelings, even those that are conflicting or confusing.
    -  Identify professional resources for additional support.

    Friends can serve an important role by identifying and helping survivors to connect voluntarily with appropriate resources. Unfortunately, you also may find yourself in situations in which you are sufficiently concerned about your friend’s well being that you need to seek help with or without your friend’s permission. If your friend or partner is in danger, either from others or from themselves, you must reach out to a trained professional.

    Examples of emergencies:
    -  Any situation in which immediate danger or threat is present
    -  A serious flashback or dissociative episode
    -  Suicidal thoughts, with a plan and/or the means
    -  Threats of harming other or property, with a plan and/or the means
    -  Stalking concerns, no matter how mild the stalking action appears to be

    Examples of other concerning situations

    -  Your friend is using coping mechanisms that concern you but do not seem immediately life threatening.
    -  You are worried your friend may be in an abusive relationship, but you aren’t sure.
    -  Your friend is missing classes, isolating themselves, eating poorly, or acting in ways that concern you.
    -  Your friend is suffering from the trauma of sexual violence and needs more support from you than you are able to provide.

    In situations like these there are confidential and non confidential resources to provide information, help you navigate the complexities of caring for your friend, and assist you with determining if and when you need to take additional steps to support your friend’s safety.

    Understanding Trauma

    Survivors may experience and exhibit a wide variety of reactions as a result of the physical and psychological impact of trauma. A survivor’s decisions, actions and feelings may appear counterintuitive and illogical when considered in the context of what we might expect under “normal” circumstances. However, when the impact and effects of trauma are taken into account, these decisions, actions and feelings may be completely logical and understandable. This may be confusing both to the survivor and to you. Although some responses are commonly seen, there is no reaction to sexual violence that is “normal” or “abnormal.”

    Common reactions

    -  Shock, confusion
    -  Memory loss or trouble accessing memories
    -  Depression
    -  Hypervigilance
    -  Mistrust of self and others
    -  Shame, guild, self-blame
    -  Anxiety
    -  Isolation
    -  Anger
    -  Denial, minimization, attempt to “normalize” their experience
    -  Physical manifestations of distress: shaking, nausea, loss of appetite, etc.

    Survivors also may experience flashbacks, nightmares, frightening thoughts, sleep disturbances, emotional numbness, and/or irritability.

- question: |
    Listen and Believe

    Active listening is an important skill when helping a friend or partner who is a survivor of sexual violence. Think about a time when you needed support, and recall someone who listened to you in a way that made you feel “heard.” How did they do that?

    DO

    -  Believe, no matter how strange, upsetting, or unlikely the events may seem
    -  Accept and honor her emotions, without judgment.
    -  Be honest. You may not “understand,” but you can empathize and care.
    -  Reflect. The only way to ensure that you understand is to ask. Try something like: “it seems like you are feeling…” and “Do you mean…?”

    -  Allow them to define their experience on their own terms. Imposing labels or definitions takes away their right to make sense of their experience for themselves.
    -  Affirm the things he is doing right, such as reaching out to you. For example, you could say, “anything you’ve done so far is the right thing, because you are here, and you are talking to me.”
    -  Meet her wherever she is in her process of healing, understanding, willingness to talk, or asking for help. Her needs will shift over time; remain flexible and present.
    -  Thank them for trusting you and respect their privacy by keeping the information confidential. If your friend has shared their experience with others, ask permission before having conversations about your friend with others.

    Avoid

    -  Suggesting how he should feel---for example, indicating that he should feel more outraged or that he should calm down.
    -  Advice that begins with “don’t.”
    -  Trying to “fix” or “rescue” her. Instead, support her in charting her own path.
    -  “Investigating” or probing for more information than your friend is willing or able to share. Avoid “why?” questions, as they can imply blame.

- question: |
    Taking Care of Yourself

    It is extremely difficult to watch someone you care about deal with sexual violence, abuse, or stalking, and it is likely to take an emotional and mental toll on you. These feelings are normal, but they can be difficult to navigate while you also are trying to be a supportive friend or partner.

    Things you may feel:

    -  Shock and disbelief
    -  Rage and helplessness
    -  Fear for the survivor’s safety or health
    -  Preoccupation with the event and its aftermath
    -  Loss of security and trust
    -  Confusion about the survivor’s responses and needs
    -  Guilt or responsibility for your friend’s experience
    -  Anger at your friend, at the assailant, or at others around you

    It is just as important to care for yourself in times of stress as it is to care for others and to seek support from someone you trust. It is also important to acknowledge your own limits. While you may care deeply for your friend and may be compelled by their trust in you, you are not a trained counselor. We all want to extend ourselves beyond our normal limits when someone is in crisis, but when doing so begins to compromise your own ability to function or leads you into situations for which you are not trained, no one is well served. In these situations, it is best to be honest with yourself and your friend.
